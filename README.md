📄 README.md — SQL Data Cleaning & EDA Portfolio Project
🧼 SQL Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
🗂️ Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a messy e-commerce orders dataset and went through a complete data workflow:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning & Standardization

Business Insights via SQL Queries

This simulates a real-world data cleaning task, where incoming datasets often contain:

Typos

Invalid formats

Duplicates

Inconsistent data types

Ambiguous values

My goal was to transform this raw dataset into a clean, query-ready format and extract insights that could inform business decisions.

🛠️ Tools Used

MySQL 8+

SQL syntax: DDL, DML, functions, regex, joins, window functions

MySQL Workbench (or any SQL IDE)

📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset contains 10 orders with the following columns:

Column	Description
order_id	Unique identifier for the order
customer_name	Full name of the customer
email	Customer email address
order_date	Date the order was placed (inconsistent)
amount	Purchase amount (mixed formats)
country	Customer's country (inconsistent naming)
🔍 Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Key Questions I Asked

Are there any duplicate order_ids?

How many unique customers are there?

Are there invalid or inconsistent values in email, amount, or order_date?

How many country name variations are there?

What percentage of data needs cleaning?

📈 Example EDA Queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders_raw;
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM orders_raw;
SELECT * FROM orders_raw WHERE amount NOT REGEXP '^[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]{1,2})?$';
SELECT * FROM orders_raw WHERE email NOT REGEXP '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$';

🧽 Phase 2: Data Cleaning
🧹 What I Cleaned
Issue	Action Taken
Name casing inconsistencies	Standardized using UPPER() and LOWER()
Email formatting issues	Validated using REGEXP, cleaned or NULLed invalid
Date inconsistencies	Parsed and standardized to YYYY-MM-DD format
Invalid or non-numeric amounts	Removed text like "one hundred", converted to DECIMAL
Negative or missing amounts	Marked as NULL for review
Country variations	Normalized to consistent values (United States, Canada, etc.)
🧱 Clean Table Structure
CREATE TABLE orders_cleaned (
    order_id INT,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    country VARCHAR(50)
);

📊 Phase 3: Data Retrieval & Business Insights
💰 Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders_cleaned;

🌍 Orders by Country
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total_orders, SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM orders_cleaned
GROUP BY country;

👤 Top Customers by Spend
SELECT customer_name, email, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders_cleaned
GROUP BY customer_name, email
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;

📅 Sales Over Time
SELECT order_date, SUM(amount) AS daily_sales
FROM orders_cleaned
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER BY order_date;

📈 Summary of Findings

Found 10 total records, with 6+ containing issues

Detected 4+ different date formats, all cleaned to YYYY-MM-DD

Cleaned up email validation issues and removed malformed entries

Normalized country names from 7+ variations to 3 core values

Removed or corrected text and negative values in the amount field

🔧 Potential Extensions

Normalize customer info into a separate customers table

Analyze repeat customers and churn risk

Connect to a front-end dashboard using Metabase or Power BI

Use Python + SQLAlchemy for automation

🙋‍♂️ About Me

I’m passionate about using SQL to turn messy datasets into clear insights. This project was designed to show how I approach real-world data quality problems using SQL alone.

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

Strong command of SQL for both cleaning and analysis

Attention to real-world issues in messy datasets

Ability to derive insights that matter for decision-makers

💡 If you're reviewing this as part of a job application — thanks for stopping by! I'd be happy to walk through the project in more detail.
